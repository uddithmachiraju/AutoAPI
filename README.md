**No more boaring and harcoding of API for your model/application.** 

### AutoAPI: Zero-Code APIs
With AutoAPI, you don’t have to hardcode the endpoints you can simply define them in the `config.yaml` file, run the application, and boom! your API is up and running.

Currently, I’m still working on it, so it might take some time before the project is ready for cloud deployment. For now, I’m focusing on local deployment.

To try the tool:
Run: 
1. `pip install -e .` - Still not yet released 
2. `autoapi run --config=config.yaml`
