## About the AutoAPI
> **No more boring and hardcoding of API for your model/application.**

AutoAPI is a CLI tool I am trying to build. So, that there is no need to hardcode the APIs in Flask/Fast anymore. You can simply define them in the `config.yaml` file, run the command, and boom! your API is up and running. The project is in its early stages of development, so there are likely many features to build and bugs to fix. Contributions of all kinds are welcome!

* I wrote some tests files nased om my current understanding of the project. To understand the project more you can play with the `config.yaml` file in the root directory and run the following commands.
1. `pip install -e .` - Still not yet released 
2. `autoapi run --config=config.yaml`
3. `autoapi dockerize --dockerfile=Dockerfile`

## How to contribute 
You may fork or clone the repo and create a new branch and write the features you want to implement/add and push them. After, you open a PR from the branch(your branch) to the main. I am gonna run/test it and conforms if it is working. After conformation, it gets merged to main.
